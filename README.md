# Check your Understanding
1. I would place my automated tests within a github action which runs whenever code is pushed. This way it checks to see if any existing code conflicts with the pushed code, as the tests would be ruined if conflicts exist.
2. I would NOT use end to end testing to see if a function returns the correct output. Unit testing is more efficient.
